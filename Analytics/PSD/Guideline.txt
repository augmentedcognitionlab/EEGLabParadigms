the first steps you need to do in order to analyze the PSD of your epochs 
1. 
open the extractSpectrogram.m. 
change it so it fits with the epoch you want to analyze 
repeat changing and running it so you have extracted all PSD info from all the wished events. 

2. 
When comparing two different types of events with each other modify and use PsdSignAnalysis 
it will provide you with a nice overview of all channels within the different frequency bands and how different the two 
conditions are from each other 

3. 
when comparing more than two conditions with each other run the ManyBoxPlot.m script. 
you may change it to fit the numbers of conditions you are dealing with, therefore there is also another altered version 
which is tailored to another experiment. 

good luck
