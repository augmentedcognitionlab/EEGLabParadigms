The analytical paradigms found in this folder are at the current state altered to work with the art in hospital dataset. 
those without the A_M prefix are analyzing two conditions up against each other. 
In case you have an experiment consisting of two different conditions these files are the one to use. 
Just rememeber to change the output file names, as they are currently working with Figurative and abstract as the condition names. 
you can change it to what ever you want. 
Also, change the baseline time point and the length of the epoch in the files in order to tailore it to your experiment. 

The analysis paradigms found in this folder is to create TSE maps (Temporal Spectral Evolution maps)
maps for each person.
average maps 
std maps 
Kruskal wallis significant maps.

First you adjust the file 
extractTSEForAllCh.m to match your data then you run it. 
it may take a while. 
then you adjust createTSEmaps.m 
Now the average, std and significnat different visuals matches that of EEGLAB and can be used for further inspection
